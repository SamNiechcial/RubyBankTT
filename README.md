# RubyBankTT

Welcome to the readme for the Bank Account Tech Test in Ruby, which is written for practice by Sam Niechcial from the March 2018 cohort at Makers Academy in Shoreditch.

The purpose of this Ruby code is to practice for the Tech Test process by building a very simple banking app which can be used from the command line using a REPL tool, such as pry.
